# Our Harmonized Data Product: 
We have developed our first harmonized natural CH4 dataset combining observation data from the chamber and eddy-covariance tower, and modeled data from process-based and inversion models. This dataset will be publicly released with a Scientific Question Sheet and AI-ready Data Managing Tool in 2026.
