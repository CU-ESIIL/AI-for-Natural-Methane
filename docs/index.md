# AI for Natural Methane (AI4NM): A Community Effort to Harmonize Natural Methane Datasets Using Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning
Welcome to the **AI for Natural Methane (AI4NM)** Working Group — a collaborative community sponsored by the **Environmental Data Science Innovation & Inclusion Lab (ESIIL)**. Our mission is to advance global understanding of natural methane sources and sinks by harmonizing model and observation datasets using **knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML)** methods.<br><br>
## Our Goals<br>
1. **Harmonize** modeled and observed natural methane datasets into an AI-ready data pool.<br>
2. **Do science** with harmonized dataset and KGML to improve our understanding of natural methane sources and sinks.  <br>
3. **Grow AI literacy** via open KGML packages and tutorials.<br>
<br><br>

## Motivation of Our Project
<img align=right src="homepage_materials/KGML_concept.png" width="300"><img align=right src="homepage_materials/Methane_Budget.png" width="300">
- Atmospheric methane (CH4) grew at the fastest rate ever recorded in 2020-2022. Slowing or reversing the accelerating growth in atmospheric CH4 will require an improved understanding of the global CH4 budget. Natural CH4 emissions are responsible for ~40% of the total global CH4 budget but remain the most uncertain factor. <br>
- **Our working group aims to build a novel Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML) framework that integrates scientific knowledge from process-based models and machine learning to harmonize simulated and observed datasets from global wetlands and soil sinks.**
<br><br>

## Goal of our Working Group
<img align=left src="homepage_materials/WG_goal.png" width="500"><br>
- The objective of this working group is to synthesize multiple measured and simulated datasets using a KGML framework to better constrain natural CH4 fluxes from wetlands and soil sinks.<br>
- This KGML framework will be designed to integrate scientific knowledge from bottom-up and top-down models, machine learning models and multi-source data through knowledge-guided architecture pretraining and training.<br>
- Specifically, we will harmonize the following four types of natural CH4 datasets within the KGML framework; We will use the bottom-up and top-down estimates of natural CH4 sources and sinks to pretrain the model. We then use observation data from chamber and FLUXNET-CH4 measurements to fine-tune the model.
