## Our Ongoing projects, papers, and sub-Working Groups
- **Harmonized Data Product**: 
We are working to generate and publicly share harmonized measured/simulated datasets and monthly global natural methane flux products from KGML at 0.5-degree resolution from 1980 to present. *The first version of data is submitted to KDD 2025 Benchmarks Track in February, 2025.*<br><br>

- **Data & code archive and visualization**
We collected the multi-source datasets and products on CyVerse and will archive the final product on the ESS-DIVE.
We will use our WG github to share all relevant codes and documentation, together with a Docker container (packaged codes and environment) for KGML.
The gridded final product from KGML will be visualized and/or accessible in public platform such as Mapbox (Example) or Google Earth Engine.
