# Sub-working group: Disturbance Ecology

## Goal of our sub-WG: 
This working group will explore how drought conditions affect methane emissions from natural ecosystems. Specifically, we will:
- Describe when, where and why we see a dampening response to meterological drought.
- Explore how coupled temperature-water relationships are incorporated in PBMs.
- Evaluate how well models capture the patterns measured with Fluxnet CH4 given the implications of coupling.

## Members of our sub-WG:
- Sparkle Malone (Lead)
  
- Progress: Concept defined, data aquired, analysis begun.
