# Sub-working group: Global methane budget and trends
- Goal of our sub-WG: This sub-working group will focus on producing new global scale estimates of natural methane sources and sinks. Products will be analyzed i) temporally to identify trends over time during reconstructions (~2000-2024) and forecasts (to 2100) as well as ii) spatially to detect regional hotspots and create methane constituency classes based upon flux seasonality, climate, phenology, and surface inundation metrics.
- Members of our sub-WG:
  - Qing Zhu (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory)
  - Gavin McNicol (University of Illinois Chicago)
