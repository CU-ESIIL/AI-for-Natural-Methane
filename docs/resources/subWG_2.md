# Sub-working group: Global methane budget and trends
- Goal of our sub-WG: This sub-working group will focus on producing new global scale estimates of natural methane sources and sinks. Products will be analyzed i) temporally to identify trends over time during reconstructions (~2000-2024) and forecasts (to 2100) as well as ii) spatially to detect regional hotspots and create methane constituency classes based upon flux seasonality, climate, phenology, and surface inundation metrics.

- Progress:
Long-term trend of wetland CH4 flux (done): Methane flux observations from wetlands are short and fragmented, limiting our ability to assess long-term trends. In this work, we developed a knowledge-guided machine learning framework that integrates EC observations, wetland soil warming experiments, and biogeochemical understanding to reconstruct multi-decadal FCH4 dynamics. Applying this approach to long-term AmeriFlux sites reveals substantial spatial variability, including increases of up to 14% per decade that weaken toward lower latitudes sites, providing a robust benchmark for ecosystem models and insights into wetland biogeochemistry.
