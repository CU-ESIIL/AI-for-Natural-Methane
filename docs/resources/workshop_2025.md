# Progress on our first in-person workshop in October, 2025
Our second in-person workshop was held from October 1 to 3, 2025 at ESIIL in Boulder, CO. We had an enthusiastic group of 25 in-person team members and 15 virtual members join the workshop.
<br><br>

**[Overarching goals]**<br>
- **1. Harmonize Natural Methane Dataset**: We presented the preliminary version of the natural methane harmonized dataset, which compiles modeled data from bottom-up process-based models, top-down atmospheric inversion models, and observational data from eddy-covariance towers and chamber measurements. During the workshop, we discussed the accompanying science question sheet that will be published with the dataset.
<br><br>
- **2. Preliminary results from sub-WG activities**: Each sub-WG conducted preliminary analysis of its projects (Sub-WG 1: Perspectives on AI and methane, Sub-WG 2: Budget and Variability, Sub-WG 3: Disturbance, Sub-WG 4: Microbial process)
<br><br>
- **3. Perspective paper on AI and ethics**: Kevin Rozmiarek led the discussion on the AI and ethics perspective paper.
<br><br>
- **4. pyKGML and data pool tool Tutorial**: Dr. Licheng Liu led the pyKGML tutorial, and Rongchao Dong led the data pool tool tutorial. 
<br><br>

**[Outcome of the workshop]**<br>
- Three papers (Sun et al., Zhu et al., Chen et al.,) are under review. Natural Harmonized Data set will be published next year.
- We are building the largest AI-ready global natural methane datasets for the terrestrial ecosystem!
