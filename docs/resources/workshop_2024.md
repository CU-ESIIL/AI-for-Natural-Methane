# Progress on our first in-person workshop in October, 2024
Our first in-person workshop was held from October 2 to 4, 2024 at ESIIL in Boulder, CO. We had an enthusiastic group of 23 in-person team members and 7 virtual members join the workshop.
<br><br>
**[Overarching goals]**<br>
- **1. Harmonize Natural Methane Dataset**: We worked on harmonizing field-based methane fluxes from chamber and eddy-covariance measurements, natural methane fluxes simulated from top-down atmospheric inversions constrained by atmospheric observations, and simulated methane fluxes from bottom-up process-based models. We collected our first set of natural methane datasets during this workshop.
<br><br>
- **2. Identify Knowledge and Gaps**: We aim to identify the current state of knowledge regarding the communityâ€™s understanding of natural methane sources and sinks, uncertainties in natural methane data and models, and how to harmonize different forms of data and models for knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML).
<br><br>
- **3. KGML Tutorial**: Dr. Licheng Liu led the great tutorial on how to run KGML for carbon quantification based on Liu et al. (2024).
<br><br>

**[Outcome of the workshop]**<br>
- We are working on 2 perspective papers (led by Shuo Chen and Kevin Rozmiarek) on (1) Pushing the Frontiers in Natural Biogenic Methane Modeling and Monitoring with Machine Learning (*Chen et al., in prep*) and (2) Ethics in AI/ML for the carbon cycle (*Rozmiarek et al., in prep*).

We navigated several challenges to progress through the groan zone and anticipate more ahead!
