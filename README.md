# [ESIIL AI for Natural Methane Working Group (AI4NM)]

Welcome to the AI for Natural Methane Working Group (AI4NM) repository, an integral part of the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). This repository is the central hub for our working group, encompassing our project overview, proposals, team member information, codebase, and more.

## Our Project
- Atmospheric methane (CH4) grew at the fastest rate ever recorded in 2020-2022. Slowing or reversing the accelerating growth in atmospheric CH4 will require an improved understanding of the global CH4 budget. Natural CH4 emissions are responsible for ~40% of the total global CH4 budget but remain the most uncertain factor. 
- Our working group aims to build a novel Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML) framework that integrates scientific knowledge from process-based models and machine learning to harmonize simulated and observed datasets from global wetlands and soil sinks.

## Documentation
